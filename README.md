# FirstProject
My project runs two tests, the first one is testing the numbers to see if they divide accordingly and give the expected value. If they do not, then an error message will be displayed showing what the expected value was, and also the one found by the program.
The second test basically does the same thing but the only difference is that this one checks if the names given are the same as the one to be expected. If not, an error message also shows the expected name and the one that was found while compiling the program.
